# HackMT_2018

Our project proposes to aide in the parking issues at MTSU. With the data collected by our program by cameras at the entrance to each parking lot, MTSU will be able to see how many cars are in each lot at all times. 

This information can be relayed via a simple campus map on mobile and students will be able to shave time off of their daily commutes by avoiding full lots.

Commutes could also be automated with this data in the future with the inclusion of google maps api and an algorithm to find the nearest empty lot to the building you are traveling to (it's a big campus).

Project could also extend to any parking lot issue in any place.
